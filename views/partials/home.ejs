                <h1>I am an extrovert who is motivated by helping others find solutions to their problems, whether in the professional world or in their personal lives. I love talking to people 1-on-1 and getting satisfaction from using my power to improve someoneâ€™s life. I get an adrenaline rush from seeing the direct results of my work and setting high targets for myself to achieve. I thrive when I am challenged and receive constant feedback to improve. I want to be in a role where I can keep growing and become a role model in my community for compassion, altruism, and leadership.</h1>
